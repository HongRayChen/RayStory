Hi, this is Ray

This is how they discribe the Toyota AE86.
My neighbor raises bees to make honey.
Oneday, I decided to go to my neighbor and steal some that sweet honey.
I opened a hive and find out.
Those were not bees. They are chainsaws, and they are angry. 
Worst of all there was no honey!!!
Fortnately there was a brand new Toyota AE86 inside.
I quickly hopped in the car and drove away,
but the chainsaws were chasing me...
