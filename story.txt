Hi, this is Ray

This is how they discribe the Toyota AE86.
My neighbor raises bees to make honey.
Oneday, I decided to go to my neighbor and steal some that sweet honey.
I opened a hive and find out.
Those were not bees. They are chainsaws, and they are angry. 
Worst of all there was no honey!!!
Fortnately there was a brand new Toyota AE86 inside.
I quickly hopped in the car and drove away,
but the chainsaws were chasing me...
Most people may think that chainsaws are not that fast, but that's not true.
Driving as fast as I could, I could barely outpace them.
If I had had some sweet honey at the time, I could've easily escaped.
Unfortunately, this was not the case...
Actrually, I am not a fan of car but I like sweet honey...

Eventually, I got an AE86 :)
